    "> ### Dataset Used:\n",
    ">> We used a very large (10GB) dataset provided by [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) along with their corresponding [documentation](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main) to identify the individual attributes, as there were a lot and many of which had unintuitive names such as 'compliment cute'. The documentation was extremely helpful.\n",

    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Dataset Information:\n",
    ">> Our dataset was initially too large to work with and contained a lot of uneccessary data. We started by identifying the most statistically significant attributes to test on by running a simple linear regression against 40 pair-wise attributes across all five JSON datasets from Yelp. Based on these we were able to identify the attributes from each instance which had the highest correlations. We ended up using ~15,500 business instances along with the following attributes for each, which included types ranging from integers to object arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Relevant Summary Stats:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Ultimately, the attributes we used, having been identified as being the most statistically significant from our regressions, include:\n",

    ">> 1. review count\n",
    "1. attributes (business)\n",
    "1. review length\n",
    "1. fans\n",
    "1. compliment plain\n",
    "1. friends\n",
    "1. useful\n",
    "\n",
    ">> We then ran a regression to test the correlation of individual attributes against each other. The strongest correlations included:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> 1. Useful (count) vs Compliment-Plain\n",
    "1. Attribute Count vs Review Length\n",

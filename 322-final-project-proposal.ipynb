    "##### Anticipated challenges in pre-processing and or classification:\n",
    "1. There are so many seemingly random attributes that many of them don't share the same combination of attributes in common. However, there are plenty of crucial attributes which are shared among almost every business such as Stars, Review count, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our feature selection will likely include analyzing the data for which attributes occur most frequently, or at the very least over 1000 instances to maximize our accuracy.\n",
